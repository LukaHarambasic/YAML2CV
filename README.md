# YAML2CV

[DEMO](https://zealous-hermann-781626.netlify.com/)

## Customize the CV
1. Go to `assets/cv.yml` and edit the file so that it fit your life and not mine :)
2. Change the image in `static/profile.jpg`
3. If you want to use the logo in the footer leave the settings true in the YAML file and change the svg in `components/Footer.vue` to your logo.
4. Change the colors in `assets/scss/_settings.scss` mainly the `$c-primary` color.
5. In the same file you can change the font but than you have to add the Google Font in the `nuxt.config.js` file.

## Run localy
1. Install all dependencies `npm install` - you only have to do this once
2. Run `npm run dev` and go to localhost:3000

## Generate CV - tested in Chrome Version 71.0.3578.98 on MacOs

## Technology
This project uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) in [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org). 

## Concepts
- content should be managed from one page
- no complex properties (object), if required the property has a custom validator to check for keys
